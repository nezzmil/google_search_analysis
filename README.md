# Google Search Analysis
This project leverages the power of Google Trends via the pytrends Python library to analyze and visualize public interest in search topics over time. By programmatically accessing Google's search trend data, the project provides insights into how interest in various topics fluctuates based on time, region, and other factors

Objective:

1) First, write a code where, by changing just the keyword, we can search for multiple things.  
2) Top 15 countries where the keywords are searched the most, and also create visual representation of  
3) A world map needs to be plotted showing the countries that search the keyword the most.  
4) We need to extract the time-wise interest of the keyword how it trended in different years.  
5) Compare related keywords and plot the graph.  

Tools & Technologies: 

Python  
Pytrends (Python wrapper for the Google Trends API)  
Pandas (for data manipulation)  
Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly (for data visualization)  
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development and analysis)  

Key Features:  

Keyword Trend Over Time  
   Pulls historical search interest for keywords  .
   Plots time-series graphs of popularity.  
Interest by Region  
   Displays which countries or states are most interested in the term.  
Related Topics and Queries  
   Shows what people also search for in relation to the main keyword.  
Comparative Analysis  
   Compares search volume of multiple keywords over time.  
Trending Searches  
   Retrieves current trending search topics globally or by region  

  Conclusion  
This project provides a hands-on approach to extracting actionable insights from Google Trends data. By automating the data collection and analysis process, it empowers users to make data-driven decisions based on real-time public search behavior.
